My find works until threshhold 4 without execdir. To manage expressions , I
used a tree by adding the operators to the root and the tests at the leaf.
I also have a test suite with shell until threshold 3.I haven't respeted the
coding style a lot evethough i tried to. 
I also respect the leaks almost all times (with everything i tested). I have
also checked for the return values with my test suite.

-----------MAKEFILE USEAGE-----

make all ----> generate myfind
make check TESTDIR =(directory name to test) ----> test with .sh
