My find works until threshhold 4 without execdir. To manage expressions , I
used a tree by adding the operators to the root and the tests at the leaf.
I also have a test suite with shell 


-----------MAKEFILE USEAGE-----

make all ----> generate myfind
make check TESTDIR =(directory name to test) ----> test with .sh
